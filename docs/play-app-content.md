# Play Console — App content answers

The answers this app gave in the Console's **App content** pages, what each one rests on, and **the
fact that would change it**. The Console shows what was answered but never why, and Play asks again:
when the app changes, when the questionnaire changes, and once a year. A re-declaration made from
memory a year from now is how a true answer turns false.

Two rules keep this file honest:

- **The privacy policy and the Data safety form describe the same facts to two audiences**, and Play
  cross-checks them. [`privacy-policy.md`](privacy-policy.md) and this file move in the same commit.
  A change to one without the other is the drift this file exists to stop.
- **A claim about permissions is read off the built artifact, never off the manifest.** A dependency
  can merge a permission the source never declared, and that is invisible from `AndroidManifest.xml`.
  `scripts/aab-permissions.py` is the reader, it runs before every upload, and its `EXPECTED` and
  `FORBIDDEN` tables are this section's twin — edit them together.

## What the artifact carries

Read at **versionCode 88, versionName 0.6.1** by `publish-play.yml`'s verify step on 2026-10-20:

> 10 permissions, all accounted for; none of the 6 forbidden ones present; 0 `<uses-feature>` declared; 0 of the 1 activities lock their orientation, every one of them expected

| Permission | Whose | What it is for | Console consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `READ_PHONE_STATE` | ours | the ringing broadcast that tells the app a call has arrived | none: runtime, asked when the feature is switched on |
| `READ_CALL_LOG` | ours | the caller's number, and whether they called in the last few minutes | **Restricted**: Play's SMS and Call Log policy allows it only for default dialers and listed exceptions. The Permissions Declaration Form decides whether this app can be on Play at all |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | ours | the ringing notification's Silence button | none |
| `VIBRATE` | ours | vibrating with the ring | none: normal, install-time |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | ours | restarts *Run in the background* after a reboot or an update, without waiting for the user to open Urgent | none: normal, install-time |
| `READ_CONTACTS` | ours | the contacts list behind *Add from contacts*, read on the phone; only the callers the user taps are kept. With *Everyone in your contacts* or *Starred contacts* on, the number of each repeated call, and of each call from the *Ring at once* list, is checked against it when it rings | Runtime, asked when either control is switched on, never at launch. Play has no `READ_CONTACTS` declaration form; Data safety is the only Console answer it touches, re-read on 2026-10-22 |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | ours | `RingThroughService` plays the ringtone for up to a minute; `KeepAliveService` keeps the app running while *Run in the background* is on | **Foreground service declarations**: one for each type, `mediaPlayback` and `specialUse`, each with a short video, asked for in App content |
| `…DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` | AndroidX | its own non-exported receivers, signature-level | none: not user-visible |

**`READ_CONTACTS` and Play's API 37 policy.**

- **Policy:** an app targeting Android 17 (API 37) or later may request `READ_CONTACTS` only when the
  Android Contact Picker cannot meet its core functionality. A custom picker does not qualify. Play
  starts prompting affected developers in September 2026, and compliance is mandatory from 27 January
  2027 ([Play Console Help 16935362](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16935362)).
- **Our status:** `targetSdk` is 36, so the policy does not apply yet. `READ_CONTACTS` is requested only
  when the user presses *Add from contacts* or turns on *Everyone in your contacts* or *Starred contacts*.
  Those choices read contacts when a repeated or *Ring at once* call rings, which the contact picker cannot do.
- **Plan before `targetSdk` goes to 37:** move the flow to the system contact picker and drop
  `READ_CONTACTS`, or file the Console declaration with the core-functionality justification. While those choices exist the picker route is closed, so only the declaration
  is left. Re-read
  this section when `targetSdk` changes; the exact picker API is checked when that migration starts.

**Forbidden, and asserted absent**: `INTERNET`, `AD_ID`, `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`,
`REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`, `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY`, `USE_EXACT_ALARM`. The first
two are what the Data safety and advertising-ID answers rest on; `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` keeps
Urgent out of Settings' *Do Not Disturb access* list, the usual route to changing Do Not Disturb.

**Two asks are not permissions and appear on no Play list**: the battery-optimisation exemption and
Xiaomi's autostart. Both are hand-offs to Settings. They need no declaration, and the privacy policy
names them anyway, because a user sent to two Settings screens should find both explained.

## Ads

**No.** Answered 2026-10-13.

Would change: any ad SDK, ever. `AD_ID` absent from the artifact is the check that would catch one
arriving through a dependency.

## App access

**All functionality is available without special access.** Answered 2026-10-13. The Console now calls this page *Sign-in details*.

There is no account and no sign-in. Would change: a feature behind a login.

## Content rating

**The IARC questionnaire.** Answered 2026-10-13, category *All other app types*, rating contact `urgentapp.support@gmail.com`. Every question answered No; the result was Everyone (ESRB), All ages (ClassInd), PEGI 3.

Not *Social or communication*: that category means the app's purpose is people talking to each other, and Urgent carries no conversation of its own.

Would change: user-generated content, communication between users, or a link out to anything that
has either. A support `mailto:` hand-off is not user-to-user communication — it opens the user's own
mail app, addressed to the developer — and a rate row opens Play's own listing, whose reviews are
Play's surface rather than the app's.

## Target audience and content

**18 and over.** Answered 2026-10-13.

Would change: lowering it. Any age band under 18 brings in the Families policy and its design and
SDK requirements.

## Government, financial and health features

**No to all three.** Answered 2026-10-13.

Health is the one to guard. **Keep health claims out of the listing, the site and the tags** —
Play's enforcement has treated a linked page as part of the listing. Would change: copy or a tag
that sells the app as good for you.

## Data safety

**No data collected. No data shared.** Answered 2026-10-13 against versionCode 18. Re-read on
2026-10-22 for the ring-time contacts check and *Ring at once*: "Does your app collect or share any of
the required user data types?" is still **No**.

Play's definitions, from its Data safety help page (support.google.com, answer 10787469) — re-read
them at each re-declaration rather than trusting this quote:

> "'Collect' means transmitting data from your app off a user's device."
>
> "User data accessed by your app that is only processed locally on the user's device and not sent
> off device does **not** need to be disclosed."

The answer rests on one fact per route data could take:

1. **The app cannot transmit anything.** `INTERNET` is absent from the artifact, and
   `aab-permissions.py` fails the upload if it ever appears. This one fact is most of the answer.
2. **The call log is read only on the device.** A few minutes of it, at the moment a call rings, to
   compare one number. Nothing from it is stored or sent. Still disclose it if the form asks about
   *access* rather than collection: the Permissions Declaration Form does.
3. **Auto Backup is still "no data collected".** The platform moves the user's backup to the user's
   own Google Drive; the developer never sees it. That is Android transmitting the user's backup, not
   the app transmitting to the developer. ⚠ Every file the backup carries lands on the user's *next*
   phone too — and here that is the settings, the chosen callers' numbers and names, and the theme (ADR-0005's amendment). Re-read on 2026-10-15 when the chosen callers landed, again when they kept names, and on 2026-10-22: the answer stands, because nothing reaches the developer.
4. **A support mail is still "no data collected", and the reason is the definition rather than an
   exemption.** A `mailto:` hands a draft to **another app**; the user reads it, can edit every line,
   and sends it from their own mail client, or does not. ⚠ **Do not write "Play exempts support
   flows" in a re-declaration.** The help page has no such exemption; the claim is true because of
   what "collect" means, and that is the reason to give.
5. **The contacts list is read only on the device: when the user presses *Add from contacts*, and, with *Everyone in your contacts* or *Starred contacts* on, to check the number of each repeated or *Ring at once* call when it rings.**
   Only the callers the user taps are kept, nothing from the list is sent, and the ring-time check keeps nothing. Still disclose it if the form
   asks about *access* rather than collection, as for the call log.

Would change any of it:

- **`INTERNET` on the artifact**, from our code or a dependency. Every answer here becomes a question.
- **Anything the app sends by itself**, such as crash reporting or analytics. There is none today.
- **Storing call-log rows, or contacts beyond the callers the user taps,** in the app's own storage, where a backup would carry them.
- **Reading the contacts list anywhere other than the *Add from contacts* button and the ring-time check.** The Data safety answer and the Console's permission questions need re-reading.

## Advertising ID

**No.** The artifact carries no `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID`, and `aab-permissions.py`
forbids it. Answered 2026-10-13.

## SMS and call log permissions

**Device automation**, for `READ_CALL_LOG`. Saved 2026-10-13 and sent for review the same day with
the first closed-testing release (0.1.0, versionCode 18).

Play's list of permitted uses decides this, and Urgent fits none of it cleanly. *Device automation*
— "automate repetitive actions across multiple areas of the OS, based on one or more conditions
(triggers) set by the user" — is the closest: the triggers are a number calling again within the 5,
10, 15 or 30 minutes the user picks, or a number on the user's *Ring at once* list, and the action is
the ring. *Physical safety/emergency alert*
allows only `SEND_SMS`, and *Caller ID, spam detection and blocking* describes a different app.

*Instructions for review*, as saved for *Ring at once* and sent for review on 2026-10-22 (496 of
500 characters):

> Urgent rings through silent, vibrate or DND for user-set triggers: the same number calling again
> within 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes, or a number on the user's Ring at once list. On a ringing call it
> reads the last few minutes of the call log on-device to compare one number; nothing is stored or
> sent, and there is no INTERNET permission. Android 9+ gives the ringing number only with
> READ_CALL_LOG; CallScreeningService skips contacts unless default dialer. Test: turn it on, set
> silent, call twice.

Would change: a refusal (Plan B is distribution off Play), the window choices, a new trigger, or any
use of the call log beyond comparing one number.

## Foreground service permissions

**`mediaPlayback`**, for `call/RingThroughService.kt`. Answered 2026-10-13 and sent for review the
same day with 0.1.0 (versionCode 18); the Console's task is *Media playback*.

- **What the user sees:** the ringtone playing on the alarm stream while a repeated call, or a call from the *Ring at once* list, rings, and
  a notification with a *Silence* button. It stops when the call is answered, declined or missed, or
  after a minute at most.
- **Why it cannot wait:** it exists only while the phone is ringing. Deferred, it rings after the
  call is over, which is no use to anyone.
- **Why this type:** the service's whole job is playing a sound the user hears. `phoneCall` is for
  the app that owns the call — a default dialer or one holding `MANAGE_OWN_CALLS` — and Urgent is
  neither. `specialUse` would claim no named type fits, and one does.
- **The video:** two calls from another phone to this one on silent, the second ringing and the
  notification visible. Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyPG5FtZvUvMMBXS_4AmYt_fBsvuuok4/view
  — 38 s, no sound (`adb screenrecord` has none, and Android's playback capture excludes the alarm
  stream anyway), the caller's name blurred. Anyone with the link can view it; keep it viewable
  while this declaration is on file — Play can re-review it on a later update or at the yearly
  re-declaration.

Would change: a change of type, or the ringing outliving the call.

**`specialUse`**, for `call/KeepAliveService.kt`. Answered 2026-10-16 under the task *Other*, with the
same description also filed by mistake as an *Other* task under `mediaPlayback`; that duplicate was
unticked and sent for review on 2026-10-22.

- **What the user sees:** a quiet, ongoing notification, *Urgent is running*, for as long as *Run in the background* is on.
- **Why it cannot wait:** the phone-state receiver should not wait for Android or the ROM to start Urgent again between calls.
- **Why this type:** the service plays no sound, carries no call and moves no data, so `mediaPlayback`, `phoneCall` and `dataSync` do not fit. The manifest carries the subtype text.
- **The video:** the notification with *Run in the background* on, while the app is not open. Link:
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGGDZ3yOkAU2wD9lGxKNgaBtPqF9v9WU/view — keep it viewable while
  this declaration is on file, as for the `mediaPlayback` one.

Would change: a change of type, or the service running without *Run in the background* on.

## Store settings (not App content, recorded here because it is asked for the same reason)

- **Category:** Communication, not Tools — the reason is in [`store-listing.md`](store-listing.md).
- **Tags:** _<tags>_.
- **Contact email:** `urgentcall.support@maksforge.com`, public on the listing.
- **Privacy policy:** `https://srednimax.github.io/urgent/privacy-policy.html`, served from `docs/` by
  Pages. It updates on a merge to `main`, with no release, which is why it has to be right before the
  app it describes ships rather than after.

## Production access — the application, and the answers it was given

**Submitted _<date>_.** Asked once, from the Console's Dashboard, after the closed test's 14 days.
Record the answers **verbatim**, not summarised: the Console asks the same set again for the next app
on this account, and an answer re-read a year later has to be the one that was given.

**About your closed test**

- *How did you recruit users for your closed test?* — _<answer>_
- *How easy was it to recruit testers?* — _<answer>_
- *Describe the engagement you received from testers* — _<answer>_
- *Provide a summary of the feedback that you received* — _<answer>_

**About your app**

- *Who is the intended audience?* — _<answer>_
- *Describe how your app provides value to users* — _<answer>_
- *How many installs do you expect in your first year?* — _<answer>_

**Your production readiness**

- *What changes did you make based on what you learned during your closed test?* — _<answer>_
- *How did you decide that your app is ready for production?* — _<answer>_

**Three things the first app built from this template kept deliberate, so a later answer does not undo
them:**

1. **The audience answer agrees with *Target audience* above.** A reviewer reads the two side by side.
   A mismatch is a question rather than a rejection, but it can cost days.
2. **Engagement is answered from what the app can know.** With no `INTERNET` permission there is no
   telemetry, so *"I do not know how many used X"* is the true answer. A guessed figure would
   contradict *Data safety* in this same file.
3. **The changes answer says where the changes came from.** If the testers reported nothing, say so and
   name what came from your own use instead. Presenting your own work as tester-driven is an easy
   dishonest sentence, and the application does not need one.

## A tip (Payments policy — not a question Play asks, but one a reviewer answers)

**Default: no tip on any surface the release controls.** Not in the app, and not on the pages the
listing links to. Read this before adding one, because the policy text and its enforcement disagree.

- **The text allows it.** Payments policy §3.2 treats a tip as a peer-to-peer payment, outside Play
  Billing, when **100% reaches the creator** and **nothing unlocks** — no badge, no theme, no
  thanks-screen. §4's anti-steering rule excepts §3. So: one personal payment link, worded as a *tip to
  a person*, never a *donation to a project*.
- **Enforcement has rejected apps anyway.** StreetComplete (February 2022) was rejected for in-app
  Patreon, Liberapay and GitHub Sponsors links — and **for a link to its own home page, because that
  page carried donation information**. A Buy Me a Coffee link in the app this template was extracted
  from was flagged the same way. None of those is the §3.2 shape (tiers unlock things, a platform takes
  a cut, a project is not a person), but the distinction has to survive a reviewer skimming for
  "external payment link", and a pre-launch rejection costs the closed-test window.
- **The reach is one level out.** The first app built from this template moved its tip from the app to
  the repository and the Pages site, then noticed that the listing's *Website* field and the last line
  of its full description point at exactly those pages. So "nothing the app links to" includes what
  the **listing** links to.
- **When to revisit:** once the app is live, with a track record to appeal from. The cheapest shape
  then is a tip on the repository alone, with the listing's Website field and full description kept
  off it. A Play Billing consumable is the unambiguous alternative, at the cost of a billing
  dependency, Google's cut, and an *in-app purchases* badge on the listing.

Region carve-outs (US external links since October 2025, the EEA's external-offers program) do not
help: both are fee programs with reporting obligations, which is not a serious route for occasional
tips. A sentence promising a *future* tip, with nothing to click, is a statement about pricing and is
fine anywhere.

## When Play asks again

1. Run `python3 scripts/aab-permissions.py` against the newest bundle, and compare its table with the
   one above. A new row is a new question.
2. Read `docs/privacy-policy.md` against the answers here. If one has moved, both move, in one commit.
3. Copy any value this file does not hold while the Console is open — a category, a date, a
   declaration's exact wording — so the next re-declaration can compare against it.
4. Re-date the sections you re-answered.
